## What It Does

An orchestration engine for autonomous AI coding agents. It provides a highly scalable, microservices-based system that connects the Claude SDK to **40+ GitHub webhook events**. By providing persistent memory, secure sandboxing, semantic codebase indexing, and an extensible plugin system, it allows you to run complex, autonomous agentic workflows directly on your own infrastructure. Everything is configured through **YAML workflows** and **plugins**:

```yaml
# workflows.yaml — create your own from workflows.example.yaml
my-workflow:
  triggers:
    events:
      - event: pull_request.opened
      - event: issues.labeled
        filters:
          label.name: "bug"
    commands: [/my-command]
  prompt:
    template: "Analyze {repo} #{issue_number}"
```

**Built-in workflows** include PR review, CI failure auto-fix, issue triage, and a generic `/agent` command. **Plugins** add specialized agents (code reviewers, CI failure analyzers, retrospector). And the agent **remembers** your codebases across sessions through persistent memory and semantic search.

Runs on your infrastructure. Scales horizontally. Full observability via Langfuse.

## Key Features

### Event-Driven Engine

- **40+ GitHub events** — PRs, issues, comments, pushes, CI/CD, discussions, labels, releases, and more
- **YAML-driven workflows** — Define triggers, commands, filters, and prompts in `workflows.yaml` (start from `workflows.example.yaml`), no code changes needed
- **Slash commands** — `/review`, `/fix-ci`, `/triage`, `/agent <request>` in any issue or PR comment
- **Horizontal scaling** — Scale sandbox workers independently: `make up SANDBOX=10`

### Claude Code Integration

The agent runs Claude SDK with the full Claude Code feature set. Because `~/.claude/` is bind-mounted from your host into the container, anything you install with `--scope user` in Claude Code CLI is automatically available to the bot — no extra configuration needed.

- **Plugins** — Install with `/plugin` in Claude Code CLI (choose user scope). Built-in plugins include PR review, CI failure analysis, and retrospector. User-installed plugins in `~/.claude/plugins/` are picked up automatically.
- **Skills** — Any `~/.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` is discovered by the SDK and invokable via the `Skill` tool. Create your own or install from the community.
- **MCP servers** — When `ALLOW_HOST_MCP=true` (default), tool permissions for host MCP servers are auto-discovered from `~/.claude.json`. Only HTTP-based servers reachable from inside Docker (e.g., via `host.docker.internal`) will work — stdio-based host servers are not proxied.
- **Memory** — Persistent per-repo knowledge across sessions. The `@memory-extractor` subagent reads session transcripts after each run and updates memory files.
- **Hooks** — Event-driven scripts on `Stop`, `SubagentStop`, and other lifecycle events. Used for Langfuse tracing and transcript persistence.
- **Subagents** — Delegate to specialized agents via the `Task` tool. Each plugin contributes its own agents (12 built in across 4 plugins).
- **CLAUDE.md** — Per-repo customization files read at session start. Define project conventions, constraints, and preferences.

### Code Intelligence

The agent doesn't explore code blindly. It uses a dedicated **Codebase Tools MCP server** backed by SurrealDB and Gemini to understand codebases structurally and semantically:

- **3-Layer Context**:
  1. **Structural**: File tree injected into the system prompt for orientation. Deep structure (call graph, imports, inheritance) available on-demand via codebase_tools MCP.
  2. **Semantic**: Hybrid search combining text matching (ripgrep) and Gemini embeddings.
  3. **Graph AST**: Code is parsed into Abstract Syntax Trees and stored as graph edges (calls, imports, inherits) in SurrealDB.
- **Advanced Graph Tools**: Agents can trace execution flows (`trace_flow`) or run BFS impact analysis (`get_impact`) to evaluate the blast radius of a change before writing code.
- **Incremental Indexing**: A background worker incrementally indexes changed files on every push, ensuring context is instantly available when a webhook triggers.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and Docker Compose
- [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) (or use `docker compose` commands directly below)
- [GitHub App](https://github.com/settings/apps/new) (see setup below)
- Anthropic-compatible API key (Anthropic, Z.AI, Vertex AI, etc.)
- ngrok or similar tunnel (for local webhook testing)

### 1. Create a GitHub App

Go to **GitHub Settings → Developer settings → GitHub Apps → New GitHub App**:

| Field              | Value                                     |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Webhook URL**    | `https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io/webhook` |
| **Webhook secret** | A random string (save for `.env`)         |

**Repository permissions:**

| Permission    | Access       |
| ------------- | ------------ |
| Actions       | Read-only    |
| Contents      | Read & write |
| Issues        | Read & write |
| Pull requests | Read & write |

**Subscribe to events:** Choose which events GitHub sends to the webhook. For the built-in workflows, enable: Issue comment, Issues, Pull request, Pull request review, Pull request review comment, Pull request review thread, Push, Workflow job. You can subscribe to more or fewer events at any time — see the [full list of supported events](docs/WORKFLOWS.md#supported-events). The agent only acts on what you enable here and configure in your [workflows.yaml](workflows.example.yaml) (copy from `workflows.example.yaml`).

After creating: note the **App ID**, generate a **private key** (.pem), install the app on your repos, and note the **Installation ID** from the URL.

### 2. Configure and Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GabsFranke/claude-code-github-agent.git
cd claude-code-github-agent
cp .env.example .env               # Edit .env with your credentials
cp workflows.example.yaml workflows.yaml    # Edit workflows (required)
cp repo-setup.example.yaml repo-setup.yaml  # Edit Per-repo dependency setup (optional)
```

```bash
# Build, start services, and open ngrok tunnel
make start

# Or step by step:
make build    # Build all Docker images
make up       # Start all services (detached)
make ngrok    # Open ngrok tunnel to webhook on port 10000

# Minimal setup (no Langfuse)
make up-minimal
```

Run `make help` to see all available targets. Service logs are written to `./logs/` per service — use `tail -f logs/webhook.log` or `make logs` to follow along.

<details>
<summary>Using docker compose directly</summary>

```bash
# Minimal setup
docker-compose -f docker-compose.minimal.yml up --build -d

# Full setup with Langfuse observability
docker-compose up --build -d
```

</details>

### Alternative AI Providers

The agent works with any Anthropic-compatible API. The easiest way to configure a provider is through `~/.claude/settings.json` — since `~/.claude/` is bind-mounted, the SDK picks it up automatically and it takes precedence over env vars:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL": "https://api.z.ai/api/anthropic",
    "ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN": "your-token",
    "ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL": "GLM-4.7-Flash",
    "ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL": "GLM-5.1",
    "ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL": "GLM-5.1"
  }
}
```

This works for Ollama, Vertex AI, Z.AI, or any Anthropic-compatible endpoint. Env vars in `.env` are still supported as a fallback but won't override `settings.json`.

<details>
<summary>Using .env instead (fallback)</summary>

```bash
# Z.AI (GLM models)
ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=https://api.z.ai/api/anthropic
ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL=GLM-5.1

# Google Vertex AI
ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_PROJECT_ID=your-project
ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_REGION=global
```

</details>

## Usage

### Built-in Workflows

| Trigger                | What happens                                           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| PR opened              | Full code review with specialized agents               |
| CI job fails           | Analyzes logs, identifies root cause, pushes fix       |
| Issue opened           | Triages with priority, complexity, and type assessment |
| Issue labeled `triage` | Same triage, triggered by label                        |

### Slash Commands

Comment on any issue or PR:

```
/review                          # Full PR review
/fix-ci                          # Analyze and fix CI failures
/triage                          # Triage an issue
/agent review the auth logic     # Generic request with natural language
/agent find all uses of deprecated API
```

## Customization

### Add a Workflow

Copy `workflows.example.yaml` to `workflows.yaml` and customize it — no code changes needed:

```bash
cp workflows.example.yaml workflows.yaml
```

Then edit `workflows.yaml` to define your triggers and behaviors:

```yaml
workflows:
  my-workflow:
    triggers:
      events:
        - event: issues.opened
      commands: [/my-command]
    prompt:
      template: "Analyze {repo} #{issue_number}"
```

See [WORKFLOWS.md](docs/WORKFLOWS.md) for the full reference, and [CONFIGURATION.md](docs/CONFIGURATION.md) for environment variables.

### Add a Plugin

You can extend the agent with plugins in two ways:

**App-specific plugins** — Create a plugin directory under the repo's `plugins/` folder with a `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` manifest. Agents, commands, and MCP servers are auto-discovered at runtime. See [PLUGINS.md](docs/PLUGINS.md) for details.

**User-installed plugins** — Install with `/plugin` in the Claude Code CLI (choose `user` scope). Plugins are saved to `~/.claude/plugins/` and automatically picked up by the SDK inside the sandbox. See the [Anthropic plugin docs](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/plugins) for more.

### Per-Repository Instructions

Add a `CLAUDE.md` to any repo root. The agent reads it before every session and persists learned knowledge across sessions.

### Per-Repository Setup

Configure dependency installation and build commands per repo in `repo-setup.yaml` — lets the agent run tests, use language tools, and build the project. See [REPO_SETUP.md](docs/REPO_SETUP.md).

"""Deployment tests for the webhook service.

Unlike the rest of the suite these talk to a *running container*, so they
prove something no in-process test can: that the image builds, boots, and
serves. Everything about request handling itself is covered in-process by
``tests/webhook/test_delivery_dedup.py``.

They are gated on ``RUN_DEPLOYMENT_TESTS=1`` rather than skipping on
``ConnectionError``. That distinction matters: catching the connection error
made "the service failed to start" look identical to "no service configured",
so a broken image was indistinguishable from a green run. With the gate, CI
sets the flag and a service that will not come up is a *failure*.

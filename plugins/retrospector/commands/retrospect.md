# Retrospector

Analyse a completed agent session transcript, identify concrete problems with how
the agent performed, and improve the instruction files that govern that agent's
behaviour. Propose changes as a pull request to the `develop` branch.

**Arguments:** "$ARGUMENTS"

- First argument: path to the session transcript summary (markdown, pre-processed)
- Second argument: workflow name (e.g. `review-pr`, `fix-ci`, `triage-issue`, `generic`)
- Third argument: target repository the session worked on (owner/repo, for context)
- Fourth argument (optional): number of turns the session took
- Fifth argument (optional): `error` if the session errored, otherwise omitted
- Sixth argument (optional): `subagent` if this is a subagent session, otherwise omitted

---

## Step 1 — Read the transcript summary

Read the transcript summary at the path given in the first argument.

The file is a structured markdown summary of the session, not the raw JSONL.
It includes:

- Total turn count and error count
- List of subagents invoked (via Agent tool calls)
- Timeline of assistant messages, tool calls, and tool results
- Summary of all tool errors

**Check the sixth argument** to determine session type:

- If sixth argument is `subagent`: This is a subagent execution session
- Otherwise: This is a main workflow session

### Agent Tool Landscape

When analyzing transcripts, you need to know what tools agents have access to so you can identify suboptimal tool usage. Agents in the sandbox have:

**Search and exploration tools:**
- `codegraph_search` — Find symbols by name or pattern
- `codegraph_context` — 360-degree view of a symbol's role and relationships
- `codegraph_callers` / `codegraph_callees` — Trace how symbols are used across the codebase

**File tools:** `Read`, `Grep`, `Glob`, `Write`, `Edit`
**GitHub tools:** `mcp__github__*` (PRs, issues, comments, reviews)
**Delegation tools:** `Agent` (subagents), `Skill` (load knowledge)
**Skills:** `codebase-context` (search system guide), `git-worktree-workflow`

### Scan For (all sessions)

- Tool calls that returned errors followed by redundant retries
- Agent tool calls — note which subagents were invoked (this is expected and good)
- Instructions that were visibly ignored (look for repeated similar tool calls)
- Steps taken in the wrong order (e.g. editing before reading)
- Excessive back-and-forth on something that should have been one step
- Missing context that led to wrong assumptions
- Any explicit failure or error in the final turns
- **Tool usage anti-patterns** (see below)

### Tool Usage Anti-Patterns

When scanning the transcript, flag these common problems:

1. **Sequential file reading** — Agent reads 10+ files one-by-one in consecutive turns. Should use `codegraph_context` or `codegraph_node` to triage, then deep-read selectively. This is the most common cause of turn exhaustion on large PRs.

2. **Manual pattern searching** — Agent reads files to find where something is defined or how a pattern works. Should use `codegraph_search`, `codegraph_context`, or `Grep` instead.

3. **Missing symbol tracing** — Agent changes or reviews code without checking where symbols are used downstream. Should use `codegraph_callers` to trace blast radius.

4. **Skill not loaded** — Agent struggles with codebase navigation but never loads the `codebase-context` skill via the Skill tool. If the instruction file doesn't reference the skill, suggest adding a reference.

When you find one of these anti-patterns, the fix is typically to update the instruction file to explicitly mention the relevant tool and when to use it.

### Additional Checks (subagent sessions)

- Whether the subagent stayed focused on its specialized task
- Missing domain-specific context for this subagent's specialty

**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT suggest that a main workflow should delegate to subagents
if the transcript already shows Agent tool invocations. Subagent delegation
is already happening correctly. Focus on whether the RIGHT subagents were chosen
and whether they were given appropriate context.

**Note:** The summary is pre-processed to avoid buffer limits. If you need more
detail about a specific turn, the patterns above should be sufficient to identify
instruction gaps.

---

## Step 2 — Decide if improvement is warranted

If the session was clean and effective — instructions followed, few errors, no
redundant loops — write a brief summary to that effect and **stop here**.

Only proceed if you found at least one concrete, actionable problem with the
agent's instructions (not with the user's request or an external service).

---

## Step 3 — Read the instruction files

Determine which instruction files govern the workflow from the second argument
and the session type from the sixth argument.

**For main workflow sessions** (sixth argument is NOT `subagent`):

| Workflow       | Command file                                      | Agent files                              |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `review-pr`    | `plugins/pr-review-toolkit/commands/review-pr.md` | `plugins/pr-review-toolkit/agents/*.md`  |
| `fix-ci`       | `plugins/ci-failure-toolkit/commands/fix-ci.md`   | `plugins/ci-failure-toolkit/agents/*.md` |
| `triage-issue` | `prompts/triage.md`                               | —                                        |
| `generic`      | `prompts/generic.md`                              | —                                        |

**For subagent sessions** (sixth argument is `subagent`):

The workflow name (second argument) is the subagent name (e.g., "comment-analyzer").

To find the subagent's instruction file:

1. Check the transcript summary header for "Subagents invoked" - it may show the full type like "pr-review-toolkit:comment-analyzer"
2. If you see a colon format like "plugin-name:agent-name", the file is at `plugins/{plugin-name}/agents/{agent-name}.md`
3. If no colon (just the agent name), try:
   - First: `Glob plugins/*/agents/{agent-name}.md` to find plugin agents
   - If not found: `subagents/{agent_name}.py` for Python subagents (edit only the `prompt="""..."""` field)

Example: For agent "comment-analyzer" with type "pr-review-toolkit:comment-analyzer":

- File is at: `plugins/pr-review-toolkit/agents/comment-analyzer.md`

Focus ONLY on this subagent's instruction file. Do not read the main workflow files.

**Subagents invoked during the session** — if Agent tool calls appear in the transcript
summary, those subagents were delegated to. For main workflow sessions, you may read
their files if the problem relates to how they were invoked or what context they received.
For subagent sessions, focus only on the subagent being analyzed.

**Skills** — skills are invoked via `/skill-name` in the transcript or declared in
a command's frontmatter (`skills:` list). They live at `skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md`.
If the transcript shows a skill was loaded or invoked, read that file too.
Use `Glob skills/*/SKILL.md` to discover all available skills if needed.

If an instruction file doesn't reference a relevant skill that would have helped
the agent (e.g., `codebase-context` for any workflow that explores code), suggest
adding a reference to load that skill.

**Also always read this file** — `plugins/retrospector/commands/retrospect.md` —
and evaluate whether your own instructions have gaps that this session exposed.

---

## Step 4 — Formulate precise improvements

For each problem you found, identify:

1. Which instruction file is responsible
2. The exact change needed (add a step, clarify wording, reorder, add an example)
3. Why this change would have prevented the specific failure observed

Be surgical. Do not rewrite files wholesale. Add, amend, or reorder specific
sections only. Preserve all working content.

Do not add generic advice. Every change must be traceable to a specific event
in the transcript.

---

## Step 5 — Create a branch and apply changes

```bash
git checkout -b retrospector/$WORKFLOW-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
```

(Replace `$WORKFLOW` with the workflow name from the second argument.)

Edit each instruction file using the Edit tool with targeted replacements.

For Python subagent files, edit only the string inside `prompt="""..."""` inside
`AgentDefinition(...)`. Do not touch the surrounding Python code.

Stage and commit:

```bash
git add <changed files>
git commit -m "retrospector(<workflow>): <one-line summary of improvements>"
```

Push:

```bash
git push origin HEAD
```

---

## Step 6 — Open a PR to develop

Use `mcp__github__create_pull_request` with `base: develop`.

PR body:

```markdown
## Session that triggered this

- **Workflow:** <workflow>
- **Target repo:** <target_repo>
- **Turns:** <num_turns>
- **Errored:** <yes/no>

## Problems identified

### Problem 1: <short title>

**Observed:** <what happened in the transcript>
**Root cause:** <which instruction was missing or wrong>
**Fix:** <what was changed and why>

(repeat for each problem)

## Files changed

- `<file>` — <one-line reason>

> Files may be commands, agents, prompts, skills (`skills/*/SKILL.md`), or subagents.
```

---

## Rules

- If nothing warrants improvement after Step 2, stop. No commit, no PR.
- Never remove content that is currently working.
- Never change the Python structure around a subagent's `prompt` string.
- Keep instruction files in the same style and format they are already in.
- One PR per session — bundle all file changes into a single commit.
- Your own instructions (`plugins/retrospector/commands/retrospect.md`) are always in scope.

# CI/CD Failure Analysis and Fix

Analyze GitHub Actions workflow failures and implement fixes using specialized agents. Agents run in a git worktree with direct file access and use GitHub MCP to interact with GitHub.

**Arguments:** "$ARGUMENTS"

- First argument: Repository (owner/repo format, required)
- Second argument: Workflow run ID or PR number (required)
- Third argument: Failure type (optional: build, test, lint, deploy, all)

## Workflow:

### IMPORTANT: GitHub Interactions

**You MUST use GitHub MCP tools for all GitHub operations. The `gh` CLI is NOT available in this environment.**

All GitHub interactions use MCP tools with the `mcp__github__` prefix:

- `mcp__github__list_workflow_run_jobs` - Get job details
- `mcp__github__download_workflow_run_logs` - Get logs
- `mcp__github__add_issue_comment` - Post comments
- `mcp__github__create_branch` - Create branches
- `mcp__github__create_pull_request` - Create PRs

Do NOT attempt to use `gh` CLI commands. Use the MCP tools listed above.

### 1. Parse Arguments & Gather Context

Extract from $ARGUMENTS:

- Repository (owner/repo)
- Run ID or PR number
- Failure type filter (optional)

### 2. Fetch Workflow Failure Information

You already have the run_id from the Workflow Failure Context injected into your prompt.

Use GitHub MCP tools to get detailed failure information:

**Get job details and identify which step failed:**

```python
mcp__github__list_workflow_run_jobs({
    "owner": "owner-name",  # Extract from repo (before /)
    "repo": "repo-name",    # Extract from repo (after /)
    "run_id": 12345678      # From event_data
})
```

Returns:

- jobs: Array of job objects
  - name: Job name
  - conclusion: success/failure/cancelled
  - steps: Array of step objects
    - name: Step name
    - conclusion: success/failure
    - number: Step number

**Download complete logs with error messages:**

```python
mcp__github__download_workflow_run_logs({
    "owner": "owner-name",
    "repo": "repo-name",
    "run_id": 12345678
})
```

Returns: Full log output as text with all error messages and stack traces.

Parse the logs to identify:

- Which job failed
- Which step in that job failed
- The actual error message
- Stack traces if available

### 3. Analyze Failure Logs

Parse logs to identify:

- **Failure type**: build, test, lint, type-check, deploy
- **Error messages**: Extract key error text
- **Failed step**: Which CI step failed
- **Stack traces**: Full error context
- **Exit codes**: Process exit status

### 4. Analyze and Implement Fixes

Based on the failure type, implement appropriate fixes:

**For Build Failures:**

- Fix compilation errors, missing imports, syntax issues
- Update dependencies in requirements.txt/package.json
- Fix configuration files

**For Test Failures:**

- Fix test logic errors and assertions
- Update test expectations if API/behavior changed
- Fix flaky tests (race conditions, timeouts)
- Run tests locally to verify: `pytest tests/` or `npm test`

**For Lint/Type Failures:**

- Use auto-fixers first: `black .`, `isort .`, `ruff check --fix .`
- Add missing type annotations
- Fix import order and unused imports
- Run linters to verify fixes

**For Deploy Failures:**

- Fix Dockerfile syntax and paths
- Update docker-compose.yml environment variables
- Fix health checks and resource limits
- Test locally: `docker build -t test .`

### 5. Commit and Push Changes

After fixes are implemented:

```bash
# Stage changes
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "fix: resolve CI failure - [brief description]

- Root cause: [explanation]
- Changes: [what was fixed]
- Tested: [how it was verified]

Fixes workflow run #${run_id}"

# Push to current branch (reuses existing branch if you're already on a fix branch)
git push origin HEAD
```

**Branch Strategy:**

- If you're already on a branch you created (e.g., `fix/ci-failure-*`), push to that branch
- If you're on the main branch or someone else's branch, create a new branch first:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b fix/ci-failure-${run_id}
  git push origin fix/ci-failure-${run_id}
  ```

### 6. Post Results to GitHub

Use GitHub MCP to communicate results:

**Option A: Comment on PR**

Use GitHub MCP (NOT gh CLI):

```python
mcp__github__add_issue_comment({
    "owner": owner,
    "repo": repo,
    "issue_number": pr_number,
    "body": summary_comment
})
```

**Option B: Create new PR with fixes (only if not already on a fix branch)**

If you created a new branch, open a PR. If you're already on an existing fix branch, skip this step (the PR already exists).

Use GitHub MCP tools (NOT gh CLI):

```python
# Check current branch first
current_branch = bash("git branch --show-current")

# Only create PR if this is a new branch (not already a PR)
if current_branch.startswith("fix/ci-failure-"):
    # Check if PR already exists for this branch
    # If not, create one:
    mcp__github__create_pull_request({
        "owner": owner,
        "repo": repo,
        "title": f"Fix CI failure from run #{run_id}",
        "body": detailed_description,
        "head": current_branch,
        "base": "main"
    })
```

### 7. Summary Format

## Failure Type Detection

Auto-detect failure type from logs:

**Build failures:**

- Keywords: "compilation error", "build failed", "cannot find module"
- Exit codes: 1, 2
- Failed steps: "build", "compile", "install"

**Test failures:**

- Keywords: "test failed", "assertion error", "expected", "actual"
- Exit codes: 1
- Failed steps: "test", "pytest", "jest", "mocha"

**Lint failures:**

- Keywords: "lint error", "style violation", "formatting"
- Exit codes: 1
- Failed steps: "lint", "format", "style"

**Type failures:**

- Keywords: "type error", "mypy", "typescript error"
- Exit codes: 1
- Failed steps: "type-check", "mypy", "tsc"

**Deploy failures:**

- Keywords: "deployment failed", "docker build", "container"
- Exit codes: 1, 125, 126, 127
- Failed steps: "deploy", "docker", "push"

## Usage Examples:

**Auto-triggered on workflow failure:**

```
# Webhook receives workflow_job.completed with conclusion=failure
# Automatically triggers: /ci-failure-toolkit:fix-ci owner/repo 12345
```

**Manual trigger with run ID:**

```
/ci-failure-toolkit:fix-ci owner/repo 12345
# Analyzes workflow run #12345 and fixes issues
```

**Manual trigger with PR number:**

```
/ci-failure-toolkit:fix-ci owner/repo 456
# Finds failed workflow runs for PR #456 and fixes
```

**Specific failure type:**

```
/ci-failure-toolkit:fix-ci owner/repo 12345 test
# Only analyzes test failures

/ci-failure-toolkit:fix-ci owner/repo 12345 build
# Only analyzes build failures
```

## Key GitHub MCP Tools:

- `list_workflow_run_jobs` - Get job details and identify failed steps
- `download_workflow_run_logs` - Fetch complete error logs
- `add_issue_comment` - Post analysis results to PR/issue
- `create_branch` - Create fix branch (if needed)
- `create_pull_request` - Open PR with fixes (if needed)

## Tips:

- **GitHub MCP only**: Use `mcp__github__*` tools, NOT `gh` CLI (not available)
- **Auto-triggered**: Runs automatically on CI failures
- **Root cause focus**: Fix underlying issues, not symptoms
- **Test locally**: Verify fixes before pushing
- **Clear commits**: Descriptive commit messages with context
- **Prevention**: Suggest improvements to prevent recurrence

## Workflow Integration:

**Automatic trigger:**

```
1. CI workflow fails
2. GitHub sends workflow_job.completed webhook
3. Agent analyzes logs and identifies failure
4. Specialized agent implements fix
5. Changes committed and pushed
6. Summary posted to PR/issue
```

**Manual trigger:**

```
1. Developer comments: /fix-ci owner/repo 12345
2. Agent fetches workflow logs
3. Analyzes failure and implements fix
4. Posts results to GitHub
```

## Notes:

- Agents run in git worktree with direct file system access
- Each agent specializes in specific failure types
- Fixes are tested locally before committing
- GitHub MCP handles all GitHub interactions
- All agents available in `/agents` list

# CI/CD Failure Analysis and Fix

You are analyzing a GitHub Actions workflow failure. Your goal is to identify the root cause and implement fixes.

## GitHub Actions Tools Available

You have access to specialized tools for fetching workflow run data efficiently:

### Progressive Access Strategy

1. **get_workflow_run_summary(owner, repo, run_id)** - Start here
   - High-level overview with job list (no logs)
   - Identifies which jobs failed
   - Fast and token-efficient (~1-2KB)

2. **get_failed_steps(owner, repo, job_id, log_lines_per_step=100)** - Most useful
   - Only failed steps with log excerpts
   - Usually sufficient for diagnosis (~5-20KB)
   - Recommended for most cases

3. **get_job_logs_raw(owner, repo, job_id, max_lines=None)** - When needed
   - Full logs for specific job
   - Use if failed steps aren't enough
   - Can limit to last N lines
   - Large logs automatically written to `.ci-logs/` directory

4. **search_job_logs(owner, repo, job_id, pattern, context_lines=5)** - Targeted search
   - Find specific patterns in logs (regex)
   - Returns matches with context (~2-10KB)
   - Useful for long logs

### Recommended Workflow

```python
# 1. Get summary to identify failed jobs
summary = await get_workflow_run_summary(owner, repo, run_id)
failed_jobs = [j for j in summary["jobs"] if j["conclusion"] == "failure"]

# 2. Get failed steps (usually sufficient)
failed_steps = await get_failed_steps(owner, repo, failed_jobs[0]["id"])

# 3. Only if needed: get full logs or search
if need_more_context:
    logs = await get_job_logs_raw(owner, repo, job_id, max_lines=500)
    # or
    matches = await search_job_logs(owner, repo, job_id, pattern="error|exception")
```

## Analysis Priorities

1. **Build Failures**
   - Compilation errors
   - Dependency resolution issues
   - Missing environment variables
   - Configuration problems

2. **Test Failures**
   - Unit test failures
   - Integration test failures
   - Flaky tests
   - Timeout issues

3. **Linting/Type Checking**
   - Code style violations
   - Type errors
   - Import issues
   - Formatting problems

4. **Deployment Issues**
   - Docker build failures
   - Container startup problems
   - Health check failures
   - Resource constraints

## Workflow

1. Use GitHub Actions tools to fetch workflow logs efficiently
2. Analyze the error messages and stack traces
3. Identify the root cause (not just symptoms)
4. Check related files for context
5. Implement targeted fixes
6. Consider edge cases and similar issues
7. Update tests if needed
8. Commit changes with clear messages

## Best Practices

- Fix the root cause, not just the symptom
- Ensure fixes don't break other functionality
- Add tests to prevent regression
- Document complex fixes in comments
- Consider CI/CD pipeline improvements
- Use progressive log access (summary → failed steps → full logs)

## Important Notes

- You have direct file system access in a local worktree
- Use local tools (Read, Write, Edit, Bash) for file operations
- Use GitHub MCP tools only for GitHub interactions (creating PRs, posting comments)
- Always test your fixes locally before committing
- Large log files are automatically written to `.ci-logs/` directory to avoid context bloat

## 🚨 MANDATORY: Post Your Results to GitHub

After committing and pushing your fixes, you MUST post a summary comment on the relevant issue/PR using `mcp__github__add_issue_comment`. Include:
- Root cause analysis
- What was changed and why
- How the fix was verified
- Link to the commit/PR

Your work is NOT complete until the summary is posted to GitHub. Do NOT stop before posting.
